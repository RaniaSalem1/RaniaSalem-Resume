        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Rania Salem. I am from the Bay Area, San Francisco to be specific. I am a second year political science with a focus in international affairs and ethnic studies major at UC Riverside. Before UCR I attended Balboa high school in San Francisco. I currently work at UC Riverside, Student Recreation Center Cooking Well Department as a cooking assistant. At my current position I help out with the cooking demonstrations that take place every week at the Student Recreation Center . In preparation for the demos, I go grocery shopping for all the ingredients that the participants need. Once we have all the needed ingredients, we portion and prepare them before the demos. During the demos, I help the participants cook their dishes and assist the chef in teaching the participants. After demos, I have to clean the kitchen, do the dishes, take out the trash, and lock up. This is one of my many job experiences. Last school year I worked at the Subway on campus. At Subway, I mostly prepared sandwiches and salads. However, I also did prep in the mornings, where I cut veggies and portioned out the proteins. I also had the opportunity of cashiering. I have also had other jobs in the food industry. This includes Jamba Juice and Chipotle. I have also worked in retail, this includes Target and a local store in San Francisco called 12 Small Things. In addition, I have experience working within the heart of the Bay Area community. I have worked at after school programs, recreation centers, and community agencies as a counselor in training. My short term goal is to graduate with honors and earn my bachelorâ€™s degree in both political science and ethnic studies. After undergrad, I plan on going to law school in the Bay Area or the midwest. I want to go into the law field because I am very involved in activism and social justice. I believe I can make a difference in this world through the utilization of laws and policy change. In turn, my long term goal is to become a human rights attorney and/or a politician. As an attorney or politician I want to do work around the broken criminal justice system in America. This includes tackling the issue of mass incarceration, which disportionately affects Black and Brown communities, specifically Black and Brown men. This also includes decriminalizing communities of color that are targeted by racist policies. As a woman of color, this work is very important to me, which is why I want to devote my life to it. In fact, I have devoted over five years of my life to activism and social justice work. This includes being a youth leader for the Arab Resource and Organizing Center in San Francisco, which fought for the liberation of all people. As a youth leader, I have done very important work such as successfully getting rid of Urban Shield as well as blocking a ship from the port of Oakland that supported the aparthied state of Israel.
